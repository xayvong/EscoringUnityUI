# EscoringUnityUI
The UI client that connects to the EscoringWeb component

Using Unity, this project connects to a WebApi (Also in my repo named EscoringSystemWeb) with multiple screens. One for the viewers, one for the scoreboard manager,
and one for the judges. Both applications need to be open for it to run on a local machine.
This software demonstrates all screens updating in real time and declares a winner before resetting.
